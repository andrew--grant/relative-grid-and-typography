# Relative Grid and Typography Demo

## A simple example of em based sizing which shows fundamental aspects of this relative unit and how to work with it.


Working with ems is easy enough, once you know the rules. Here are the rules.

At a font size of 100% we can equate 1em to to 16px.

An em is equal to the current font size

An em is a 'relative' unit. That is to say, at a font size of 200% we can now equate 1em to 32px, not the 16px mentioned above. 

If we want to work work with given pixel values, we can. We can use the formula *target รท context = result*

In the above formula *context* can change. Remember, an em is equal to the current font size. See the style rule and associated comment under the H1 element in the demo
