## Relative Grid and Typography Demo

### A simple example of em based sizing which shows fundamental aspects of how this CSS unit works. 

Working with ems is easy enough, once you know the rules. Here are the rules.

* At a font size of 100% we can equate 1em to to 16px.

* An *em* is equal to the current font size

* An *em* is a 'relative' unit. That is to say, at a font size of 200% we can now equate 1em to 32px, as opposed to the 16px it was represented at when using 100%. 

* If we want to work work with given pixel values, we can. We can use the formula *target รท context = result*.

* In the above formula *context* can change. Remember, an *em* is equal to the current font size. See the style rule and associated comment on the H1 element in the demo.
